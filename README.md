# Explainable Deep Learning  
## Instructions  
In this assignment, you will work with pretrained deep learning models to investigate model explainability in computer vision. Your objective is to apply GradCAM and at least two of its variants to a meaningful image classification problem of your choice and analyze how and why the model makes its decisions.  

You are encouraged to select an image classification task that holds personal or societal significance. Potential areas include, but are not limited to: wildlife conservation, road safety, public health, environmental sustainability, or social impact. You may use an existing public dataset or a curated subset, and pretrained models such as ResNet-50 or Vision Transformers (ViT).
